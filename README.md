- **UI-Based Test Creation**: Easily create tests by selecting actions directly from a visual interface without writing code.
- **Multiple Action Types**: Choose from actions like `Click Element`, `Fill Input`, `AI Visual Assertion`, and more to build comprehensive test scenarios.
- **Reusable Tests**: Mark tests as reusable, enabling their integration into larger test suites and saving time on repetitive actions.
- **Scheduling**: Tests can be scheduled in suites to automate periodic testing, ensuring consistent application performance.
- **Visual Assertion with AI**: Make use of AI-powered visual assertions to validate the appearance and structure of the application’s interface.

## How It Works

1. **Define the Test Scenario**:
   - Specify the target URL to start the test.
   - Select from different action types to define each step in the test flow.

2. **Add Actions**:
   - **Click Element**: Select UI elements to be clicked on during the test.
   - **Fill Input**: Populate input fields with specified data.
   - **AI Visual Assertion**: Use AI to confirm that the page or elements appear as expected.
   - **Wait for Delay**: Pause the test for a set period, useful for waiting on animations or transitions.

3. **Run and Review**:
   - Run the full scenario to validate each step.
   - View the results, including logs, to troubleshoot or confirm the test’s accuracy.

4. **Save as Reusable**:
   - Save the test as reusable, allowing it to be included in other tests and suites, which can optimize the testing process for larger projects.

5. **Schedule in Suites**:
   - Schedule tests within suites to automate frequent testing cycles and keep track of application health over time.
